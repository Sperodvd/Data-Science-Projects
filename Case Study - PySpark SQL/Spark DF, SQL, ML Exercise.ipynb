Spark has matured to the stage now where for 90% of what you need to do (when analysing tabular data) should be possible with Spark dataframes, SQL, and ML libraries. This is where this exercise is mainly trying to focus.  \n<br>\nFeel free to adapt this exercise to play with other datasets readily availabe in the Databricks enviornment (they are listed in a cell below). \n#####Getting Started\nTo get started you will need to create and attach a databricks spark cluster to this notebook. This notebook was developed on a cluster created with: \n- Databricks Runtime Version 4.0 (includes Apache Spark 2.3.0, Scala 2.11)\n- Python Version 3\n\n#####Links & References\n\nSome useful links and references of sources used in creating this exercise:\n\n**Note**: Right click and open as new tab!\n<br>\n1.

If true, the algorithm will cache node IDs for each instance. Caching can speed up training of deeper trees. Users can set how often should the cache be checkpointed or disable it by setting checkpointInterval. (default: False)\ncheckpointInterval: set checkpoint interval (&gt;= 1) or disable checkpoint (-1). E.g. 10 means that the cache will get checkpointed every 10 iterations. Note: this setting will be ignored if the checkpoint directory is not set in the SparkContext. (default: 10)\nfeatureSubsetStrategy: The number of features to consider for splits at each tree node.

If a split causes the left or right child to have fewer than minInstancesPerNode, the split will be discarded as invalid. Should be &gt;= 1.

(default: 1.0)\nthresholds: Thresholds in multi-class classification to adjust the probability of predicting each class. Array must have length equal to the number of classes, with values &gt; 0, excepting that at most one value may be 0. The class with largest value p/t is predicted, where p is the original probability of that class and t is the class&#39;s threshold.
